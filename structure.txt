MODULES
- draw()
- input(player)
   (change what they draw based on current input)

BODY
- update(dt)
  (player, all objects are based on this)

IMAGES
- draw(id, x, y, r)
  (draw particular pre-set up image in specific place with specific rotation)

main
- sets things up
- update(dt) (fixed rate)
  (should probably just world:update() ?)
- draw()
  (should probably just world:draw() ?)

keypressed
- passed directly to player
- this should be changed?

WORLD
- getSector() literal sector object
- changeSector() stupid thing calls sector:enter() and stuff

PLAYER
- drawModules() just loops through modules and draws them
- opcode() accepts input, handles, passes to methods
- warp tries to move locally or jump sector
- abortWarp cancels a warp (uh oh, the warp is implemented in a way I can't do this right now!)
- openComms WOULD check a target for its comms feature?
- scan WOULD check a target for details
- laser WOULD insta fire and draw a laser line (HOW DRAW IT THOUGH?! O.o)
- missile WOULD fire missile in one direction or locked onto something

SECTOR
- enter()
- changeSector() WHY
- update()
- draw()
- getTarget()
- after() (cron jobs, good thing to have here)
