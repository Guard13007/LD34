- warp tries to move locally or jump sector
- abortWarp cancels a warp (uh oh, the warp is implemented in a way I can't do this right now!)
- openComms WOULD check a target for its comms feature?
- scan WOULD check a target for details
- laser WOULD insta fire and draw a laser line (HOW DRAW IT THOUGH?! O.o)
- missile WOULD fire missile in one direction or locked onto something
