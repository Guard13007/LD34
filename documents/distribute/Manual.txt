Note: This manual is meant to explain the basics of flying your ship. There are
quick reference notes in game, as well as modules you can get fairly early on to
make things easier!

You start with a shuttle with damaged controls, and have to use op-codes to
control it. Typing 1's and 0's will execute the commands below:

- 000 Selects targeting mode. (Targets are necessary for most actions.)
- 001 Selects heading mode. (From here you control all movement except warping.)
- 010 Starts warp. (If targeting anything, you warp to it. Else, in the
  direction you are facing.)
- 011 Stops warp. (Cancels the countdown for a current warp command.)
  (Note: This will also used for certain advanced commands.)
- 100 Opens communications. (You must either have targeted something, or have
  received a communication. Targets are preferred over received communications.)
- 101 Scans a target. (Providing you with information about it. Can also trigger
  events.)
- 110 Fires a laser at a target. (This will damage shields, or mine asteroids,
  or damage unshielded targets.)
- 111 Fires a missile at a target. (This will damage targets, or obliterate
  asteroids, but you have a limited number of missiles.)
