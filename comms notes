If only 1 item returned, don't display and wait for answer, just display along
bottom of screen for x time. Else, display and wait for answer.

- communication
  false or contains communication response in the form of
  1: response
  2: option 0
  3: option 1
  or
  1: response
- commsTarget
  this is so targets aren't removed by incoming communications
  when incoming -> (if target) then set commsTarget, (else) set target
  ((commsTarget is only ever used for comms, if target becomes unset, it should be
  set with commsTarget ??))
  (note: display thing for displaying where who communicating with you)
- commsHistory
  table of past communication datas
  every time communication is set to false, whatever was in it gets inserted here
- communicate(from, message)
  called by others to send a message, message will be a communication table;
  and from will be who is sending this message
  this function should store the communication (message) and (if AI) set a delay
  to respond, (elseif player) prompt that a message has arrived
  (you must open comms to read and reply to it)

Player has:
