- when debris is created, it is informed of its
  source, some debris have a chance of containing some things from its
  source
  - NOTE: Must be careful! If debris are created independently, debris could
    duplicate items!
- add loading screen (for assets, require images / audio once to have them loaded)
- add libs used / licensing info
- NOTE: anything destroyed that has set a cron job in its sector will not have it
         cleared!! fix that

--NOTE for Lady, which I am not sure I can use.

-- if you use MiddleClass, you don't have to register every class manually if
-- you include the following function definition after importing MiddleClass
-- and Lady:
function class.Object.static:subclassed(other)
    lady.register_class(other)
end

-- saving
-- (what are these parameters? are they specific objects to save?)
lady.save_all(file_name, player, enemy_list, goal_list)

-- loading
-- (I guess they are..)
player, enemy_list, goal_list = lady.load_all(file_name)
```

```
--NOTE for sandbox
sandbox(fn) --returns sandboxed function
sandbox.protect(fn) --same thing
sandbox.run(fn) --sandboxes, then runs fn
```

NOTE: If Lady doesn't work or I want smaller (or harder to read) save files...
