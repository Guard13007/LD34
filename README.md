# LD34 (Or "Opcode-Powered Shuttle")
Use opcodes to pilot your shuttle. Create an empire.

Currently incomplete, due to the pressure of having only 48 hours to work on it, and not using all of them.

- **What works**: Movement, targeting, warp.
- **What doesn't**: Communication, scanning, weapons.

Originally, you would start with just "sticky notes" telling you how to fly your ship. Later you would be
able to install "modules" to customize your ship's interface and make it easier to fly, as well as start
colonies or something..maybe. I never planned that far ahead because I was rushing just to get it working.

Unlike my last Ludum Dare attempt, this runs, and doesn't have a game-breaking crash in it! (As far as I
know, but because I said that, it will have a game-breaking bug now, I'm sure.)
